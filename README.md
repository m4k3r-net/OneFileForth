# OneFileForth
A single file implementation of a non-standard Forth written in the FIG style
This project is hosted on GitHub, and can be cloned as follows:

	git clone http://github.com/paraplegic/OneFileForth .

# Building
This project should make out of the box on most systems, and particularly
on Linux and/or BSD:

	make test

The Makefile will support both the BSD make and the Linux GNU style make
(or gmake on BSD).  The OneFileForth should compile on cygwin with minor changes
but as I don't run DOS/Windows, I have no need for Cygwin.  Sorry, you're on your
own.
